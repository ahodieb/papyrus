## TODO

* [ ] Go back to basics, calling cli opens notes at the latest entry. (default mode)
* [ ] Add nvim and neovide editors
* [ ] Replace viper with a simpler cli
* [ ] Install using brew
* [ ] Github action to build new versions
* [ ] 📒 add documentation, usage, description for the project
* [ ] Add documentation website/page .. (mkdocs sounds reasoable)
* [ ] ♻️ ⚡️ Use git for managing backups instead of backup logic

* [ ] ✨ Change the template of the new day entry to include If only section , maybe a todo section too ?

* [ ] ✨ add tags automatically to words
* [ ] ✨ auto close off the past entry timestamp
* [ ] ✨ check if clipboard contains a link, and add additional tags to entry (e.g. pull request link -> #pr)

* [ ] 🐛 When journal has no journal entries, but has some text, add the entry to the end of the file
* [ ] ✨ root command on a same day with args args, add entry, open editor
* [ ] ✨ Add time based rules e.g (catchup between 10:00 to 10:30)
* [ ] ✨ write new today sentence (today)
* [ ] ✨ generate weekly status
* [ ] ✨ generate breakdown report for time spent
* [ ] ✨ reminder to add entry to the journal
* [ ] ✨ cli runs a server to display stats, and other reports (UI)
* [ ] 📒 write a blog post to share with others ("this is how i manage my notes")
