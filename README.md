## TODO

* [x] ♻️ Port to golang
* [ ] ♻️ 🚀 Make script
* [ ] ♻️ ⚡️ Use git for managing backups instead of backup logic
* [ ] ✨ generate weekly status
* [ ] ✨ round time for new entries to 5 minute blocks ?
* [ ] ✨ add tags automatically to words
* [ ] ✨ add rules for what root command does
  * [ ] on a new day, insert a new section and open editor
  * [ ] if same day, no args open editor
  * [ ] if with args, add entry
* [ ] ✨ Add time based rules e.g (catchup between 10:00 to 10:30)
* [ ] 🤷‍♀️ can papyrus access calender ?
* [ ] ✨ write new today sentence (today)
* [ ] ✨ generate breakdown report for time spent
* [ ] ✨ auto close off the past entry timestamp
* [ ] ✨ reminder to add entry to the journal
* [ ] ✨ cli runs a server to display stats, and other reports (UI)
* [ ] ✨ check if clipboard contains a link, and add additional tags to entry (e.g. pull request link -> #pr)
* [ ] ♻️ ✅ Refactor Cli and possibly find a better approach than static/global variables
* [ ] ♻️ 🎨 Reformat my old journals into new format
* [ ] ♻️ 🎨 Import notes from one-note
* [ ] ♻️ 🎨 Import notes from quip
* [ ] 📒 add build/development instructions ( i don't expect external contributions, but could be useful for me updating the code in 6 months)
* [ ] 📒 add documentation, usage, description for the project
* [ ] 📒 write a blog post to share with others ("this is how i manage my notes")
* [ ] 🎉 open source Papyrus
* [ ] 📒 add setup instructions ( if needed i'm already covered by setup-mac.sh )
